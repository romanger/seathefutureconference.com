            <h2>About the conference</h2>
        <p><b>More informatsion has been collected about the oceans in the past few years than in the entirety of human history that came before.</b></p>

<p>This explosion of data sources - from weather systems to ship movements and supply chains - and the quality and quantity of data available have the potential to fundamentally change the way we understand the oceans and the maritime ecosystem. What if we could turn this potential into reality? What if we could use this data and information to improve the way risk is managed and business is done? What if we could enhance supply chains and help preserve fragile maritime ecosystems?</p>

<p><b>The Inaugural 'Sea: The Future' Conference will look at how technologies, such as artificial intelligence, can help us interact with the maritime domain in a more efficient, profitable, and sustainable way.</b></p>

<h2>Why attend</h2>
<p><b>'Sea: The Future'</b> is a one-day conference that will bring together senior decision-makers from the worlds of shipping, government, insurance, data and risk management to discuss the future of the maritime domain.</p>
<p>​​Hear from maritime CEOs on implementing new, tech-driven business models. Explore how new technologies and data can give you a competitive edge. Better understand emerging tech and how it can fit your business needs. Demystify AI.</p>
